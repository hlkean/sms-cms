# SMS -> CMS 
This repo is a tool to make managing and updating content on websites built using various CMS offerings easier.

Many small business owners use CMS products to manage their digital presence. These tools are invaluable, but often require users to log into clunky, non-responsive web interfaces to make small content updates. When you're on the go or have more business critical tasks to focus on, finding the time for this can be a big task. Creating a SMS-based interface for updating content will make this process faster, and easier, and therefore lead to more accurate and up to date content on sites. This ultimately benefits business owners and the customers they serve.
